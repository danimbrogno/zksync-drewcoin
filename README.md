# Proof of Palooza - Whitepaper

Drewapalooza is an annual event steeped in lore, tradition and culture. However we must recognize that the social fabric that binds us is at risk.

As we enter middle age, we must acknowledge the factors that threaten to diminish the potency, vigor and virility that we bring to this cherished annual event. 

Fortunately blockchain technology has arrived just in time to preserve the original intent of Drewapalooza: To unite the gentlemen of [REDACTED] Ridge High School and their associates, if only for one weekend a year.

Without further delay, I humbly submit to you my governance proposal for "Proof of Palooza", a decentralized autonomous organization dedicated to preserving the rich culture of Drewapalooza.

## The Threat

As our responsibilities have broadened. Wedding anniversaries, childrens birthdays and deadlines set by the board of Fortune 500 companies are threats to the attendance of each Paloozateer.

We may find that fear of divorce, emancipation, or breach of employment contract act as disincentivizes to attend.

Additionally, we must recognize that as we age our feeble minds may forget how important Drewapalooza is to us. Our shared culture will weaken if we do not act now to preserve our distinct traditions.

Already, important aspects of our oral history have been lost.

Things such as:

- Who saved Ryan from drowning after all?
- Which edition of Fast and the Furious are we supposed to watch this year?
- Whose fault was it that Drew's barbeque combusted?

## The Solution

By launching DrewCoin ($DREW), we create a financial instrument which adequately rewards participants for their commitment to Drewapalooza.

The initial supply of $DREW will be set at 1,000,000 units to be divided equally among all paloozateers (eligibilty criteria TBD).

Each year an additional issuance of $DREW will be set by the governance committee.

At the close of each Drewapalooza the governance committee will be responsible for:

- Recording the official attendance
- Selecting a slogan that captures the essence of that year's Palooza, (e.g. "The Year of the Barbecue FlambÃ©", "The Year of the Gift Card Tip", or "The Year Mike Made out with a Knob").

Paloozateers who are found to be in attendance will receive:

- An equal share of that year's issuance of $DREW.
- An NFT "Proof of Palooza" that commemorates that year's slogan.


## Governance Committee

The composition of the governance committee is TBD. 

Eligibility criteria for the governance committee include:

- Palooza attendance record
- Technical proficiency
- Not being named Drew

The governance committee will comprise any number of odd members > 1. All actions taken by the governance committee require a signature by a simple majority.

## Utility

$DREW can be spent freely by holders of the token and may be bartered in exchange for goods and services such as: 

- Preferred access to the bunkie
- Rides to/from the marina
- Non-violent retaliation to jokes about one's family members

I submit to you this draft proposal for your consideration and comment.
